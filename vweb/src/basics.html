<h2>What is Vulcan?</h2>

<p>
    Vulcan is an imaginary computer: it doesn't (yet) exist as a real chip, but there are a couple emulators which allow
    other computers to run Vulcan programs. Vulcan programs are a sequence of numbers stored in memory; each number is
    an instruction and the computer runs them in sequence to manipulate the state of the machine. Some memory locations
    in Vulcan are tied to (emulated) devices like a monitor, mouse, keyboard, and mass storage, so reading or writing
    those locations allows Vulcan to interact with the outside world.
</p>

<p>
    Writing programs as a sequence of numbers is obviously very convenient and easy, but I've written some tools anyway:
    the first is an assembler which will translate textual names of instructions into the numbers they correspond to (as
    well as do some other bookkeeping). Because even writing assembly language can be tedious, there is also a
    high-level language called NovaForth that runs on Vulcan itself, and a different high-level language which runs on a
    normal computer but compiles programs which run on Vulcan.
</p>

<h2>Vulcan is a stack machine</h2>

<p>
    The model of computation Vulcan uses is called a <em>stack machine,</em> because instructions manipulate a stack of
    values in memory and most data transfer in the machine is done through that stack. There are 42 Vulcan instructions,
    each of which might consume values from the data stack or leave other values on top of the stack. Each instruction
    can also take a single optional <em>argument,</em> which is pushed to the stack before the instruction runs.
</p>

<p class="sidebar">
    Stack machines are a very common model for imaginary computers, although most hardware computers are <em>register
    machines</em> instead, for efficiency. Vulcan's main design goal is simplicity, over speed, though, so it's
    appropriate here. It's also very common to emulate a stack machine using a register machine, and translating
    between the two computation models isn't hard.
</p>

<h2>First program</h2>

<p>
    Here's a short example program:
</p>

<div class="snippet">
    <pre>
push 2
push 3
add
hlt
    </pre>
</div>

<p>
    Going line-by-line through this program: the first instruction is a <span class="mono">push</span> instruction with
    an argument of <span class="mono">2</span>. The <span class="mono">push</span> has no actual effect on the machine
    (in fact, it's another name for the instruction <span class="mono">nop</span>, for "no operation"). But, the fact
    that it has an argument means that the argument will be added to the top of the stack, so, after this line, the
    stack contains a <span class="mono">2</span>. The second instruction is the same, and pushes its argument on top of
    the 2, so after that line the stack contains <span class="mono">2, 3</span>. The next instruction,
    <span class="mono">add</span>, has no argument, but the function of the instruction is to remove the top two values
    from the stack and push their sum in their place: now the stack contains <span class="mono">5</span>. Finally the
    <span class="mono">hlt</span> instruction (short for "halt") tells the machine to stop running.
</p>

<p class="sidebar">
    Why halt? Because Vulcan memory starts out initialized to random values, like all memory: without this, we would
    continue to run, executing random memory contents as instructions, forever (or until we executed a combination of
    instructions that caused the machine to enter an error state and reset).
</p>

<h2>Instruction encoding</h2>

<p>
    In memory, this program is represented by six bytes: two bytes each for the <span class="mono">push</span>
    instructions, one byte each foo <span class="mono">add</span> and <span class="mono">hlt</span>. Vulcan instructions
    are always between one and four bytes long:
</p>

<pre>Instruction     Argument bytes
     |          |            |
     v          v            v
  |------##|--------|...|--------|
         ^
         |
     Number of
   argument bytes</pre>

<p>
    The higher six bits of the first byte determine which instruction it is, and the lower two bits determine how many
    bytes the argument is: 0-3 bytes, because a standard memory cell in Vulcan is 24 bits (3 bytes) long. The
    instruction <span class="mono">push 2</span> is therefore two bytes long, <span class="mono">0x0102</span>:
</p>

<pre>00000001 00000010</pre>

<p>
    The instruction <span class="mono">0</span> is <span class="mono">push</span> (or <span class="mono">nop</span>), it
    has one byte of argument, and that one byte is the number <span class="mono">2</span>. The entire program above is:
    <span class="mono">1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 116</span>.
</p>

<p>
    Because any instruction can take an argument, which is treated as a push, we can shorten this program by one
    instruction:
</p>

<div class="snippet">
    <pre>
push 2
add 3
hlt
    </pre>
</div>

<p>
    Any time there's a <span class="mono">push</span> followed by an instruction with no argument, we can remove the
    push and move its argument to the following instruction. This makes Vulcan programs somewhat easier to understand
    than otherwise, and also saves some memory; this program is only five bytes long:
    <span class="mono">1, 2, 5, 3, 116</span>
</p>

<h2>Memory layout</h2>

<p>
    Properly, each of these programs should start with a directive telling the assembler where they should go in memory.
    The default location is fine for these examples (they will run the same way no matter where they are) but we can
    place them somewhere with a <span class="mono">.org</span> (short for "origin") directive:
</p>

<div class="snippet">
    <pre>
.org 0x400
push 40
mul 40
hlt
    </pre>
</div>

<p>
    The default Vulcan memory map looks like this:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        0 to 255 (<span class="mono">0x00</span> to <span class="mono">0xff</span>): reserved for I/O devices
    </li>
    <li>
        256 to 1023 (<span class="mono">0x100</span> to <span class="mono">0x3ff</span>): default location of the stack
    </li>
    <li>
        1024 (<span class="mono">0x400</span>): start executing code here on reset
    </li>
    <li>
        Anything after <span class="mono">1024 + your program size</span>: available for use
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The first 256 bytes of memory are reserved for I/O control registers: reading and writing these may affect devices
    like the screen, serial device, keyboard controller, etc. Not all are used, but you shouldn't use them in your
    program because someday they might be.
</p>

<p>
    The next 768 bytes are the stack: since Vulcan uses a <em>word size</em> of 24 bits, stack cells are 24 bits long,
    which means the stack is 256 cells long. It can be moved around or made smaller or larger using the
    <span class="mono">setsdp</span> instruction, but that’s where it starts.
</p>

<p>
    Immediately after the stack is location 1024, or <span class="mono">0x400</span>: this is where your program is
    initially loaded, and when the machine is powered on (or reset) this is where it will start reading and executing
    instructions.
</p>

<p>
    Everything after that is available for use by your program, up to a usual total memory size of 128k... Although for
    programs that use video, a large portion of that memory is used by the video display.
</p>

<h2>The call stack</h2>

<p>
    The Vulcan stack isn't just one stack, there are two: the basic one we've already seen is the <em>data</em> stack,
    growing upward from location 256, but there is also a <em>call</em> stack (sometimes called a <em>return</em> stack
    or <em>R</em> stack) growing downward from location 1023. Here’s an example program that uses both stacks:
</p>

<div class="snippet">
    <pre>
.org 0x400
push 2 ; Push a couple values to the stack
push 3
pushr ; Move the one on top to the other stack
pop ; Remove the 2…
popr ; Move the 3 back
hlt
    </pre>
</div>

<p>
    This puts a couple values on the stack and then deletes the one second-from-the-top, by first moving the top value
    to the other stack to get it out of the way. The <span class="mono">pushr</span> and <span class="mono">popr</span>
    instructions move the top value from the data to the call stacks and back again, respectively;
    <span class="mono">pop</span> removes the top value from the data stack.
</p>

<p>
    Just having a second stack for temporary storage is somewhat handy, but the actual purpose of the call stack is the
    <span class="mono">call</span> and <span class="mono">ret</span> instructions: when you execute a
    <span class="mono">call</span> Vulcan stores the address of the next instruction in the call stack and starts
    running code at a different address (whatever is on top of the stack). A <span class="mono">ret</span> does the
    opposite; pops an address from the call stack and goes back to running code there. We can use
    <span class="mono">call</span> and <span class="mono">ret</span> to make a subroutine and call it repeatedly:
</p>

<div class="snippet">
    <pre>
.org 0x400
push 1
call triple
call triple
call triple
hlt

triple:
mul 3
ret
    </pre>
</div>

<p>
    There are a few new concepts in this snippet, so we’ll tackle them one-by-one: first, the line
    <span class="mono">triple:</span> is called a <em>label</em>; it doesn't correspond to an instruction, it just tells
    the assembler to give a name to a particular location in the program so we can refer to it elsewhere. Whatever the
    memory address of the next instruction is, whenever we write <span class="mono">triple</span> in our program, it
    will be replaced with that address.
</p>

<p>
    The next instruction is <span class="mono">mul 3</span>, which does exactly what it sounds like: just like
    <span class="mono">add</span>, <span class="mono">mul</span> pops two values and pushes their product.
</p>

<p>
    Which leaves the <span class="mono">call</span> and <span class="mono">ret</span> lines: we're pushing a 1 and
    calling <span class="mono">triple</span> three times; each call will jump the execution to the
    <span class="mono">mul 3</span> line, then to the <span class="mono">ret</span> line, which will jump to the
    location after each call. After tripling a 1 three times we're left with a 27 on the stack and we halt.
</p>

<p>
    In terms of a higher level programming language, <span class="mono">triple</span> could be a function that takes a
    single number as a parameter and returns that number times 3:
</p>

<pre>function triple(x) {
  return x * 3
}</pre>

<h2>Branching and conditionals</h2>

<p>
    The true power of any computer is its ability to change its operation based on its input: to make decisions; do one
    thing with one piece of data and a different thing with another. Vulcan has instructions to do this:
    <span class="mono">brz</span> and <span class="mono">brnz</span> are short for "branch if zero" and "branch if
    non-zero," and will move to running a different part of the program depending on whether the top-of-stack value is
    zero or not. Here’s an example program:
</p>
<div class="snippet">
    <pre>
.org 0x400
push 1
call collatz
push 2
call collatz
hlt

collatz:
dup
mod 2
brz @halve
mul 3
add 1
ret
halve:
div 2
ret
    </pre>
</div>

<p class="sidebar">
    The Collatz Conjecture is an unsolved problem in mathematics: suppose you take any positive integer and, if it’s
    even, divide it by two; if it’s odd, multiply it by three and add one. Repeat this process indefinitely and it will
    eventually enter a loop going from 1 to 4 to 2 back to 1. But, there is no known proof that this is true, there
    might be other numbers that form Collatz loops and don’t return to 1.
</p>

<p>
    The first part of this program is pretty basic: call the <span class="mono">collatz</span> function on the numbers 1
    and 2. Where it gets interesting is what that function does: first it uses <span class="mono">dup</span> (short for
    "duplicate," pushes another copy of the top-of-stack to the stack) and <span class="mono">mod 2</span> (short for
    "modulus," returns the remainder when two numbers are divided) to tell whether the number is odd or even: an even
    number will leave a 0 on the stack, and odd number a 1.
</p>

<p>
    Then we use <span class="mono">brz</span> to branch to <span class="mono">halve</span> if there's a zero (if the
    number is even). It's important to note the <span class="mono">@</span> in front of
    <span class="mono">halve</span>, the <span class="mono">brz</span> instruction takes a relative address, and it's a
    common mistake to leave off that operator and instead use an absolute address.
</p>

<p class="sidebar">
    Relative vs absolute addresses are a simple concept that's easy to forget about: an absolute address is just the
    address of a given instruction in memory; every instruction has one absolute address, and instructions like
    <span class="mono">call</span> and <span class="mono">jmp</span> use this number. A relative address is the address
    of another instruction minus the absolute address of this instruction; you can think of it as "move this many bytes
    forward or backward." Just like remembering labels, the assembler will calculate relative addresses for us, if we
    prepend an <span class="mono">@</span> on to the name.
</p>

<p class="sidebar">
    Why use relative addressing? To allow for position-independent code: if we used absolute addressing everywhere, our
    program would only work when loaded into memory at a particular location. Eventually we'll want to write an
    operating system that loads programs from disk at arbitrary locations and runs them; since the program won't know
    where it's loaded, it will need to use relative addresses to refer to parts of itself.
</p>

<p>
    Whether it actually goes to the other branch or not, <span class="mono">brz</span> consumes the zero-or-one from the
    stack. If it was a 1, then we just continue on this branch: multiply by 3, add 1, return. If it was a 0, then we
    skip those three lines, jumping straight to <span class="mono">halve</span>, and divide by 2 and return.
</p>

<p>
    We can also use this to write loops:
</p>

<div class="snippet">
    <pre>
.org 0x400
push 1
loop:
dup
add 1
dup
lt 10
brnz @loop
hlt
    </pre>
</div>

<p>
    This will leave the numbers 1-10 on the stack: we start with a 1, duplicate it and increment it, and then check if
    the result is less than 10 (<span class="mono">lt</span>, "less than," consumes two numbers and pushes a 1 if the
    second is less than the first, 0 otherwise). If it is, we branch back to the <span class="mono">loop</span> label
    and do it again; otherwise halt. Note that we have to <span class="mono">dup</span> the number before the
    <span class="mono">lt 10</span> check because <span class="mono">lt</span> consumes both numbers: we need a copy to
    save on the stack and a copy for <span class="mono">lt</span> to consume!
</p>

<h2>Variables and memory</h2>

<p>
    So far all our programs have used the stack to store their data, but of course we have 128k of memory we can store
    whatever we want in. Here’s a program that puts some of that to good use:
</p>

<div class="snippet">
    <pre>
.org 0x400
push 1
loop:
dup
loadw sum
add
storew sum
add 1
dup
lt 101
brnz @loop
pop
loadw sum
hlt
sum: .db 0
    </pre>
</div>

<p>
    Starting with the last line first: the <span class="mono">.db</span> directive is short for "define byte" and, like
    <span class="mono">.org</span>, doesn't represent an instruction: it just causes the assembler to put three bytes
    containing whatever value we want into the program. It needs to go at the end because if it were at the start
    Vulcan would try to execute it as code (which in this case would actually be safe, because three bytes of 0 is just
    three <span class="mono">nop</span> instructions, but still).
</p>

<p>
    Having reserved a memory location for our variable and given it a name (the label <span class="mono">sum</span>) we
    can do a loop much like the previous example: load the value from <span class="mono">sum</span>, add the top of the
    stack to it, store it back into <span class="mono">sum</span>, increment the top of the stack, repeat for every
    number between 1 and 100. Finally throw away the now-useless counter variable and load <span class="mono">sum</span>
    one last time, leaving the sum of the numbers 1-100 (5050) on top of the stack.
</p>

<p>
    Vulcan has four instructions for reading and writing arbitrary memory:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="mono">load</span> and <span class="mono">store</span> read and write a single byte at a time.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="mono">loadw</span> and <span class="mono">storew</span> (short for "load word" and "store word")
        read and write three bytes (one stack cell) at a time.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Most variables in Vulcan are one word long; reading and writing single bytes is usually used for manipulating
    individual characters in strings.
</p>

<h2>Assembler macros</h2>

<p>
    Certain structures in assembly are very common to write, like an if / else condition or a loop. In order to prevent
    errors writing these the Vulcan assembler provides several <em>macros</em> that generate these common structures for
    us. Importantly, these aren't new instructions, they're commands to the assembler to generate sequences of
    instructions (and single-use labels) for us.
</p>

<p>
    The simplest of these is the <span class="mono">#if</span> macro:
</p>

<div class="snippet">
    <pre>
.org 0x400
push 10
#if
push 1
#else
push 2
#end
hlt
    </pre>
</div>

<p>
    When the assembler encounters an <span class="mono">#if</span> it generates a <span class="mono">brz</span> to the
    corresponding <span class="mono">#else</span> or <span class="mono">#end</span>. Just like a conditional in a
    high-level language, <span class="mono">#if</span> constructs can have <span class="mono">#else</span> branches
    (which are executed if the top-of-stack is false) and can be nested inside one another. There is also an
    <span class="mono">#unless</span> macro that acts the same as <span class="mono">#if</span> but inverted: it only
    executes its body if the top-of-stack is 0:
</p>

<div class="snippet">
    <pre>
.org 0x400
push 0
#unless
push 1
#else
push 2
#end
    </pre>
</div>

<p>
    The other macro construct is <span class="mono">#while</span>, which is used to create loops:
</p>

<div class="snippet">
    <pre>
.org 0x400
#while
loadw counter ; Load the loop counter…
lt 101 ; and check if it’s still 0..100
#do
loadw counter ; Increment the sum by the counter
loadw sum
add
storew sum
loadw counter ; Increment the counter by 1
add 1
storew counter
#end
loadw sum ; Finally load the sum and stop
hlt
counter: .db 0
sum: .db 0
    </pre>
</div>

<p>
    The loop is divided into two sections: one <em>condition</em> between the <span class="mono">#while</span> and
    <span class="mono">#do</span>, and a <em>body</em> between <span class="mono">#do</span> and
    <span class="mono">#end</span>. The condition is executed first, and only if it leaves a nonzero on the stack (which
    is consumed) is the body executed. Then the condition is executed again, and so on. Just like
    <span class="mono">#if</span>, these can be nested (and nested inside conditionals and conditionals inside them),
    and there's an inverted version called <span class="mono">#until</span>:
</p>

<div class="snippet">
    <pre>
.org 0x400
#until
loadw counter ; Load the loop counter…
gt 100 ; and check if it’s still 0..100
#do
loadw counter ; Increment the sum by the counter
loadw sum
add
storew sum
loadw counter ; Increment the counter by 1
add 1
storew counter
#end
loadw sum ; Finally load the sum and stop
hlt
counter: .db 0
sum: .db 0
    </pre>
</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
